   <p>  1. My service does not manage a to-do list. Instead my service
           manages student grades.</p> <br>
   <p>  2. I used mySQL to make a relaional database and
           I do not have multiple databases.</p><br>
   <p>  3. I used express for my web service to interact with my students database</p><br>
   <p>  4. My project is avaliable at https://project2.woodmanwebdev.me:8443/</p><br>
   <p>  5. All of my endpoints have appropriate names so 
           they are easy to use and navigate</p><br>
   <p>  6. My web service can send and recieve complex JSON</p><br>
   <p>  7. The full spectrum of CRUD has been tested and is 
           supported with my web service</p><br>
   <p>  8. I blocked all of the ports specified using a firewall except for the ones I needed
       for SSH and my web servers.</p><br>
   <p>  9. I created a Nginx server that allows global, encrypted access to your web service.</p><br>
   <p>  10. My web service is supported on cross-origin sources using an options wildcard 
        endpoint and custom middleware</p><br>
   <p>  11. I used pm2 to run my service and it is currently running</p><br>
   <p>  12. My github repository has been shared with user twodee</p><br>
   <p>  13. My database creation and schema scripts are provided in my github repository</p><br>
   <p>  14. I had various issues trying to get my github repository to work with my droplet,
        I do not show steady commits but have been working on the project in increments</p><br>
   <p>  15. My report is avaliable through my service at
        https://project2.woodmanwebdev.me:8443/report.html</p>
